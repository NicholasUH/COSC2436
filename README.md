# COSC2436
This repository contains all of my programming assignments for my COSC2436 - Data Structures
class taught by Prof. Rizk during Fall 2022.

IMPORTANT: Files will not work on their own as the professor wanted inputs done in a certain fashion, so I decided that the code be meant to be read and not compiled.
